            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>The most difficult thing in human life is to find yourself. Every year of your conscious 
            life you learn something new. Childhood, youth, adult life - all these stages 
            are accompanied by a huge amount of information.
             At every stage, a person wants to find something that will be to their liking.
            That's how I have worked in different positions in my life. 
            He worked as an accountant at a large factory and in a private firm. 
            Worked in telephone sales as a manager, worked in direct sales as a sales assistant. 
            And in each position I studied, learned different skills.
            Thoroughness, perseverance, communication, attentiveness, punctuality, improvisation,
             initiative, stress resistance - these psychological skills have been developed
              in the process of working in various specialties, but in addition to all this,
               impressive knowledge and experience have accumulated.
             Despite this, I am sure that there are things that I do not know, even in the areas in which
              I have worked, that I still have to learn.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintilian">Quintilian's</a>  famous aphorism "it's never too late to learn" very well describes my position in life.
                Our whole world is studying in the class of an ordinary school with the name “life”,
                 it goes differently for everyone, but everyone learns.
